This project is currently split into two folders. 
  One is the Bootloader ive written from scratch. I plan to come back to this, but it requires much more knowledge 
than I currently have.
  The other folder is limineBareBones. I've taken the code from the limineBareBones example to start, and am building my 
own kernel on top of it. After this has been fleshed out I plan to go back to making my own bootloader so that all of the 
codebase will be written by me.
